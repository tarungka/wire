# Engineering Roadmap & Recommendations for Wire

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive engineering roadmap and strategic recommendations for Wire. The primary goal is to transform Wire from its current early stage into a production-ready, best-in-class distributed streaming platform. A key ambition is for Wire to significantly outperform established systems like Apache Flink in specific areas, particularly developer experience (DX), operational simplicity, resource efficiency, and certain performance niches, while matching or exceeding core streaming capabilities.

## 2. Current State Summary

Based on an analysis of existing documentation and the project's public information:

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Architectural Foundation:** Built on Go, leveraging Raft (via `hashicorp/raft`) for distributed consensus, providing a solid base for fault tolerance.
    *   **Modularity:** Initial design shows good separation of concerns (e.g., store, pipeline, HTTP service).
    *   **Extensibility:** Pluggable source/sink architecture and support for multiple database backends for the Raft store.
    *   **Go Language Benefits:** Potential for high performance, efficient concurrency, and simpler deployment (single binaries).

*   **Critical Gaps & Weaknesses:**
    *   **Core Streaming Engine Features:**
        *   **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL):** No distinct, robust WAL for input data durability.
        *   **Checkpointing/Snapshotting:** FSM snapshotting is incomplete; comprehensive pipeline state checkpointing for fault tolerance is missing.
        *   **State Management for Operators:** Advanced, scalable state management for streaming operators (keyed state, windowed state) is not yet developed.
        *   **Exactly-Once Semantics (EOS):** Planned but not implemented; a complex and critical feature.
        *   **Backpressure Handling:** Rudimentary or planned; essential for stability under load.
        *   **Event Time Processing & Advanced Windowing:** Major features like event time processing, watermarks, and sophisticated windowing (session, custom triggers) are planned for the future.
    *   **Developer Experience (DX):**
        *   **High-Level APIs:** A user-friendly, idiomatic Go API for defining complex dataflows is needed.
        *   **Documentation:** User guides, comprehensive examples, and operational playbooks are lacking. `README.md` is sparse.
        *   **Testing & Debugging:** Dedicated tools and frameworks for testing and debugging Wire pipelines are required.
        *   **SQL Interface:** Planned but not yet available.
    *   **Operational Maturity:**
        *   **Observability:** Comprehensive metrics, distributed tracing, and structured logging are in early planning stages.
        *   **Deployment:** Cloud-native deployment options (Kubernetes operator, Helm charts) are long-term goals.
        *   **Upgrades & Maintenance:** Tools and procedures for zero-downtime upgrades and disaster recovery are not yet developed.
    *   **Security:** TLS/mTLS, authentication, and authorization are not yet fully implemented.

*   **Overall Assessment:** Wire is an early-stage project with a promising architectural direction. However, it currently lacks many of the critical features and the operational maturity required for a production-grade streaming platform. The ambition to compete with Apache Flink is high and will require focused, intensive development on core functionalities and developer experience.

## 3. Core Requirements for a "Best-in-Class" Streaming Platform (Recap)

To achieve its goals, Wire should aim to excel or be highly competitive in the following areas:

*   **Usability & Developer Experience (DX):** Intuitive APIs, simplified local development, comprehensive documentation, rapid iteration.
*   **Scalability & Performance:** High throughput, low latency, horizontal scalability, efficient resource utilization.
*   **Fault Tolerance & Reliability:** Exactly-once semantics, robust checkpointing, WAL, rapid automatic recovery, HA.
*   **Advanced Streaming Modules & Features:** Comprehensive state management, event time processing, advanced windowing, rich connector ecosystem.
*   **Observability:** Detailed metrics, distributed tracing, structured logging, user-friendly dashboards.
*   **Deployment & Operations:** Cloud-native, simplified configuration, zero-downtime upgrades, easy cluster management.

## 4. Prioritized Engineering Roadmap

    *   Ensure at least two reviewers for critical components. Establish clear code style guidelines.
    *   **Action:** Create/update `CONTRIBUTING.md` with coding standards and review process.
*   **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
    *   Automate builds, linting, testing (unit, integration, basic performance) on every commit/PR.
    *   **Action:** Expand existing GitHub Actions to cover more comprehensive testing stages.
*   **Static Analysis:**
    *   Utilize tools like `golangci-lint` with a strict configuration. Integrate security scanners (e.g., `govulncheck`).
    *   **Action:** Review and enhance the current `.golangci.yml`.
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   Regularly update dependencies and monitor for vulnerabilities (e.g., Dependabot).
    *   **Action:** Ensure Dependabot is configured and active.
*   **Modular Design & Clear Interfaces:**
    *   Continue emphasizing modular design with well-defined and stable interfaces.
    *   **Action:** Before implementing major new modules, explicitly define and review their public APIs/interfaces.
